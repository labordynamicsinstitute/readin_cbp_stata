NOTE:  The "EMPFLAG" field (Data Suppression Flag) denotes employment size class for data withheld to avoid 
disclosure (confidentiality) or withheld because data do not meet publication standards.  Similarly, each 
employment size class has it's own data suppression flag (field names f1_4, f5_9, ... f1000).
